<p>This is a post about an interesting testing technique which feels like it should
be well known. However, I haven&#8217;t seen it mentioned anywhere. I don&#8217;t even have
a good name for it, I&#8217;ve semi-discovered it in the wild. If you know how this
thing is called, please leave a comment!</p>

<p>I was reading Dart analysis server source code, and came across
<a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/f6d2c2378a00160ca1b79f8f7bd45df97b1275e4/pkg/analysis_server/lib/src/services/correction/assist_internal.dart#L1063">this
line</a>. Immediately I was struck as if by lighting. Well, not exactly in the same
way, but you get the idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What does this line do? I actually don&#8217;t know, but I have a guess. My
explanation is further down (to give you a chance to discover the
trick as well!), but the general idea is that this line helps
tremendously with making tests more maintainable.</p>

<h2 id="the-two-mundane-problems"><a class="anchor" href="#the-two-mundane-problems"></a>The two mundane problems</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two tasks which programmers typically enjoy less than furiously
cranking out new features are maintaining existing code and writing
tests. And, as an old Russian joke says, maintaining tests is the
worst. Here are some pain points specific to the post:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Negative tests</strong>. You want to check that something does not
happen. Writing a test in this situation is tricky because the test
might actually pass for a trivial reason instead of the intended
one. The rule of thumb is to verify that the test actually fails if
the specific condition which it covers is commented out. The problem
with this rule of thumb is that it works in a single point in time. As
the code evolves, the test might begin to pass for a trivial reason.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Duplicated tests</strong>. Test suites are usually append-only and grow
indefinitely. Almost inevitably this leads to a situation where
different tests are testing essentially the same features, or where
one test is a superset of another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Bifurcated suites</strong>. Somewhat similar to the previous point, you may
end up in a situation where a single component has two separate
test-suites in different parts of the code base. I&#8217;d want to say that
this happens when two developers write tests independently, but
practice says that me and me one month later are enough to create such
a mess :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Tests discoverability</strong>. This is a problem a new contributor usually
faces. Finding a piece of code where the bug fix should be applied is
usually comparatively easier than locating the corresponding tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The underlying issue is that it is non-trivial to answer these two
questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Given a line of code, where is the test for this specific line?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given a test, where is the code that is being tested?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="the-solution"><a class="anchor" href="#the-solution"></a>The solution</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The beautiful solution to this problem (which I <strong>hypothesise</strong> the
<code>_coverageMarker()</code> line in Dart does) is to track code coverage on the
test-by-test basis. That is, when running a test, verify that
<strong>specific</strong> lines of code were covered by this test.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve put together a small Rust library to do this, called
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/uncover"><code>uncover</code></a>. It provides two macros:
<code>covered_by</code> and <code>covers</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first macro is used in the code under test, <a href="https://github.com/matklad/tom/blob/081b09e90b4ff64246969783fe9fb9261ba188f1/src/factory.rs#L72-L75">like

<p>If the block where <code>covers</code> is used does not cause the execution of

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Under the hood, this is implemented as a global <code>HashMap&lt;String, u64&gt;</code> which
counts how many times each line was executed. So <code>covered_by!</code>

in <code>Drop</code> that the count was incremented. It is possible to disable these checks
at compile time. And yes, the library actually

a macro which defines macros</a> :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I haven&#8217;t had a chance to apply this technique in large projects (and
it is less useful for smaller ones), but it looks very promising.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s now easy to navigate between code and tests: just ripgrep the
string literal (or write a plugin for this for your IDE). You will be
able to find the test for the specific if-branch! This should be
especially handy for new contributors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If this technique is used pervasively, you also get an idea about the
overall test coverage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During refactorings, you became aware of tests which might be
affected. Moreover, because coverage is actually checked by the tests
themselves, you&#8217;ll notice if some test stop to exercise the code it
was intended to check.</p>
